# API Project for Holberton School Back-End

## Overview

This repository contains the API project developed as part of the Holberton School Back-End curriculum. The API is designed to provide a backend service for various front-end applications, demonstrating the principles of RESTful design, data persistence, authentication, and authorization.

## Features

- **RESTful API Design**: Implements standard RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations.
- **Data Persistence**: Utilizes a database (specify which DB is used, e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) for storing and retrieving data.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Supports user authentication and authorization with JWT tokens or another method.
- **Modular Architecture**: Codebase is organized in a modular architecture for easy maintenance and scalability.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js (Specify version)
- Express.js (Specify version)
- Database (MySQL/PostgreSQL/MongoDB, specify version)
- JWT for authentication
- Any other libraries or frameworks used

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version)
- npm (version)
- Database installation (MySQL/PostgreSQL/MongoDB)
- Postman or similar API testing tool

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/carlfrank/holbertonschool-back-end.git

Navigate to the api directory:
cd holbertonschool-back-end/api

Install NPM packages:
npm install

Create a .env file and configure your environment variables (e.g., database connection settings, JWT secret key).

Running the API
Start the server:
npm start
The API will be accessible at http://localhost:3000 (or another port specified in your environment variables).

Usage
Provide examples of how to use your API, including how to authenticate, how to make requests to different endpoints, and any important considerations.
